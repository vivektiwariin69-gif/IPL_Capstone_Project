IPL Data Analysis & Visualization (Capstone Project)
🏏 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. Using Python's powerful data science stack, I have analyzed player performances, team statistics, and match trends to uncover insights that drive the game.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used
Python (Core Logic)

Pandas & NumPy (Data Cleaning and Manipulation)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Static Statistical Visualizations)

Plotly & Cufflinks (Interactive Charts for deep-dive analysis)

📊 Key Insights Analyzed
Venue Performance: Identified stadiums with the most matches and their impact on game outcomes.

Top Performers: Analysis of players with the most runs, highest wickets (e.g., Umran Malik, Jasprit Bumrah), and best bowling figures.

Interactive Trends: Used Plotly to create zoomable charts for total bills and player strike rates.

Correlation Heatmaps: Visualized the relationship between different match factors using Seaborn
